# Cyber Bubble

Cyber Bubble is a web app designed as a space for people to be in their ‘bubble’ while documenting thoughts and ideas. It was inspired by the pandemic and the longing for travel as many people miss the familiar sounds of home. Hence the app has audios that are meant to provide a sense of familiarity to those who are working, studying or just going about their daily lives.
